Installation
# checking out the repository as your vim directory
  cd
  mv .vim .vim_old
  git clone git://github.com/murilasso/vimfiles ~/.vim
# checking out all the plugins
  cd ~/.vim
  git submodule init

Also, put "source ~/.vim/vimrc" (without the quotes) inside the .vimrc in your home directory.

Notes
To make vim-ruby's completions (among other stuff) work, vim must be compiled with ruby support.

To check if you vim has ruby support type `vim --version |grep ruby` in your terminal. If the output contains '+ruby' you're good to go. If not, you must compile vim with ruby support.

Make sure you have ack installed in your system, in order to the ack.vim plugin works.

To make gist-vim work, you need to set your github token in gitconfig.
